# An Introduction to the Lattice Boltzmann Method (24h)
### Lecturer: Prof. Sauro Succi 

## Course description

In this mini-course we hell expound the main ideas behind the Lattice Boltzmann
for fluids (and beyond). After revisiting the fundamentals of Boltzmann kinetic theory
we shall describe the principles which govern the transcription of the Boltzmann to the
lattice framework. These principles shall be illustrated first for the simple case of 
advection-diffusion-reaction equations in one space dimensions.
Subsequently, we shall describe the LB formulation of Navier-Stokes hydrodynamics 
in two and three spatial dimensions, as well as the techniques to impose the most
common boundary conditions.
Finally, we shall illustrate the extension to non-ideal fluids with applications to multiphase flows with dynamic phase transitions.

All theoretical subjects are accompanied by hand-on lectures/exercises 
using simple warm-up codes. For historical reasons, such codes are written 
in fortran, but transcription to C, matlab or python is straightforward.

As a final exam, the students will be required to solve some simple exercises 
requiring the development of their own computer programs and present a 
final project on a subject of their choice, possibility related to their own original
research.


## Requirements

Some notions of numerical computing and coding practice (in whatever language).
Some fore-knowledge of statistical physics and most notably 
Boltzmannâ€™s kinetic theory would be helpful.
